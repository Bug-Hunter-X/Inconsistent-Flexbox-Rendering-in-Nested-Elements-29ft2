The following CSS code results in unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

div > span {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

The inner span should fill the entire div but it may not, or the layout may shift unexpectedly. This can occur if the parent div has a height that depends on its content, and the inner span doesn't properly account for this.  Certain browsers' flexbox implementations might handle this inconsistently.
