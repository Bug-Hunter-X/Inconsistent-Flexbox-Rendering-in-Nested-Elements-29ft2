# Inconsistent Flexbox Rendering in Nested Elements

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with CSS flexbox layouts where nested elements might render inconsistently across different browsers. The problem arises when a parent flex container's height is implicitly determined by its content, and the child element attempts to fill the parent's dimensions. Some browsers might handle this edge case differently, leading to unexpected layout shifts or misaligned elements.

## Problem Description:

The provided `bug.css` file contains CSS code that sets up a nested flexbox layout. The outer div should occupy 50% of its parent's width and height, while its inner span aims to fill the entire div. However, the rendering might vary depending on the browser.

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.css` file shows a fix that enhances the reliability of the flexbox layout across various browsers. This solution improves the consistency of the layout by explicitly defining the height of the parent div or using other techniques to ensure the correct rendering of nested elements.
